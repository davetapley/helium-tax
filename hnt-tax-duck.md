# HNT / IOT Tax 2023 and beyond

## Requirements

### Export transaction data

Sign up for [Hotspotty](https://app.hotspotty.net/) and [add your wallet](https://docs.hotspotty.net/getting-started/manage-wallets).

I'm not affiliated with Hotspotty, but I found it is [cheapest](https://app.hotspotty.net/pricing) and easiest for exporting.


### Get database tool

Download [duckdb](https://duckdb.org/docs/installation/?version=stable) command line tool (free).

Open a terminal / command prompt and `cd` to the folder where you unzipped `duckdb` (`duckdb.exe` on Windows).

Run (Mac / Linux):
```bash
./duckdb rewards.db
```

Run (Windows)
```
./duckdb.exe rewards.db
```

### Get transactions in to database

[Export your data](https://docs.hotspotty.net/features/payment-management/tax-reporting) in Hotspotty, choosing date range Jan 1 2023 to Jan 1 2024 (we will filter to correct time zone later, this is to ensure we get everything, as Hotspotty uses UTC time).

Download the CSV file, rename it to `rewards.csv` and move it to where you unzipped the `duckdb` to.

Import `rewards.csv` into the database:

```sql
CREATE TABLE rewards AS SELECT Token AS token, to_timestamp("Start Date") AS time, Amount AS amount FROM read_csv_auto('rewards.csv');
```

Filter date to your local time zone (since hotspotty exports in UTC, and `duckdb` will use your local zone):

```sql
DELETE FROM rewards WHERE time < '2024-01-01';
DELETE FROM rewards WHERE time >= '2025-01-01';
```

Verify which tokens you have:

```sql
SELECT distinct(token) FROM rewards;
```

For tax year **2024** only: You should have only `IOT` in the output. If otherwise please see [previous the version of this document](https://github.com/davetapley/helium-tax/blob/3b9228b054f8cfdc633570edc3e5592e750146eb/hnt-tax-duck.md).



### Get price data in to database

Download price data as csv (via â†“ icon on far right of header):

https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/helium-iot/historical_data

Move the downloaded `iot-usd-max.csv` to the same folder as `rewards.csv` and `duckdb`.

Import in to database:

```sql
CREATE TABLE iot_usd AS SELECT snapped_at AS date, price FROM read_csv_auto('iot-usd-max.csv');

DELETE FROM iot_usd WHERE extract('year' FROM date) <> 2024;
```

Join prices with your rewards:

```sql
CREATE VIEW usd_rewards AS SELECT time, amount * price AS usd FROM rewards ASOF JOIN iot_usd ON time >= date;
```

Summarize your rewards in USD:

```sql
SELECT sum(usd) FROM usd_rewards;
```

This number is your total rewards in USD in 2024.

You are done.
